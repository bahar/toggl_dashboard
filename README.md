# Introduction

[Toggl](http://www.toggl.com) is a pretty neat time tracking tool. If a small team is using Toggl to track their time log, it might be a good idea to have a dashboard to show everyone who is doing what.

This small webapp is for that. It shows each member's current active task.

It's based on [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), [BootStrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com).

# Configuration 

* Copy `tokens.example.py` to `tokens.py`, then put your team members' Toggl API tokens there.
* Copy `app.example.yaml` to `app.yaml`, then do App Engine configurations in it. Applicaiton name must be changed.
